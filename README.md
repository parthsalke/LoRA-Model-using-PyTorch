# LoRA Model for Efficient Fine-Tuning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** for fine-tuning large language models efficiently. LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters, making adaptation feasible even on resource-constrained hardware.

## Features
- Implements **LoRA** for efficient model fine-tuning  
- Reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining model performance  
- Supports integration with popular transformer architectures  

## Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- Transformers (Hugging Face)  
- PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning)  

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

2. Run the Jupyter Notebook
